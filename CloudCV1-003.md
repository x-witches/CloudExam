# Comptia Cloud+ Beta exam

1. Explain the importance of high availalbity and scaling in cloud environments:
 	1. Hypervisors: 
		1. Affinity and Anti-Affinity

2.1 Given a scenario, configure indenty and access management:
	-Directory Services: 
		-LDAP

2.2 Given a scenario, secure a network in a cloud environment:
	-Network Segmentation: 
		-Generic network virtualization encapsulation (GENEVE)
	-Tunneling: 
		-Generic routing encapsulation(GRE)
	-Network services: 
		-Application delivery controller (ADC)
		-Packet brokers (Comment: There is a startup called "Packet Broker" which made this hard to study for)

2.3 Given a scenario, apply the appropriate OS and application security controls.
	-Hardened baselines: 
		-Single Function (Comment: I could not find any info on this)

2.4 Given a scenario, apply data security and compliance controls in cloud environments:
	-Cloud access security broker (CASB)

2.5 Given a scenario, implement measures to meet security requirements:
	-Risk Register (comment: seems to be more of a project management topic)

3.2 Given a scenario, provision storage in cloud environments
	-Protocols: 
		-Non-volatile memory express over fabrics (NVMe-oF)
	-Software Defined Storage (SDS)

3.3 Given a scenario, deploy cloud networking solutions:
	-Software Defined Network (SDN)

3.4 Given a scenario, configure the appropriate compute sizing for a deployment:
	-Virtualization:
		-Hypervisors: Type 1 and Type 2

3.5 Given a scenario, preform cloud migrations:
	-Database migrations:
		-Relational
		-Non-Relational

4.2 Given a scenario, maintain efficient operation of a cloud environment.
	-Polices:

4.3 Given a scenario, optimize cloud environments:
	-Network:
		-SDN

4.4 Given a scenario, apply proper automation and orchestration techniques:
	-Infrastructure as code:
		-infrastructure components and their integration
	-Continuous integration/continuous deployment(CI/CD)

4.5 Given a scenario, preform appropriate backup and restore operations:
	-Mean time to recover (MTTR)

5.2 Given a scenario, troubleshoot security issues:
	-Misconfigured or failed appliances:
		-WAF

5.3 Given a scenario, troubleshoot deployment issues:
	-Missing or incorrect tags (comment: I again was not able to research this topic)

5.4 Given a scenario, troubleshoot connectivity issues:
	-Common networking configuration issues:
		-Peering
	-Load Balancers:
